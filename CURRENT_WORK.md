- [x] Varied background textures (wood, marble, gradients)
- [x] Noise objects (buttons, coins, paper clips)
- [x] Consistent card sizes within boards
- [x] Grid layout with 9-12 cards per board

### Model Training
- [x] Detector: YOLOv11n, mAP50=99.5%, mAP50-95=97.4%
- [x] Classifier: MobileNetV3, 100% accuracy

### Infrastructure
